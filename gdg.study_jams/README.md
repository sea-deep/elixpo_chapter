# GDG Cloud Skills Leaderboard — Purpose

A lightweight, public leaderboard designed to surface participant progress and engagement for Cloud Skills learning activities. This project exists to make learning achievements visible, encourage friendly competition, and simplify event coordination for GDG on Campus — JISU and similar community initiatives.

Why this exists
- Provide a clear, at-a-glance ranking of participants based on measurable progress (badges, mini-games).
- Recognize and motivate learners by showcasing completed work and milestones.
- Help organizers monitor participation, celebrate top contributors, and identify learners who may need encouragement.
- Offer simple filtering and search to focus on specific groups (e.g., completed, redeemed access codes).

Key highlights
- Public-facing and easy to share during events or on community channels.
- Fast to deploy and view — no complex setup required for basic use.
- Designed for clarity: ranks, badges, mini-games, redeemed codes, and completion status are emphasized.
- Supports quick discovery (search) and focused views (filters) for common organizer needs.

Intended audience
- Community organizers running Cloud Skills or learning-based events.
- Educators and mentors tracking cohort progress.
- Participants seeking recognition and a summary of their achievements.

Privacy and data approach
- Built to display only the essential public-facing progress indicators (names, counts, statuses).
- Avoids exposing internal analytics or sensitive personal data.
- Suitable for community-led, transparent sharing of learning progress.

Outcome
- Encourage engagement through visibility and recognition.
- Reduce administrative effort in tracking progress.
- Foster a community-driven environment that highlights achievement and supports learners.
